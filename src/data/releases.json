Opening track 'Archetype 1:Selbst' is a foray into melodic breakbeat oriented electronica with mystical ethereal voices, big arpeggios, and cinematic pads. Archetype 2: Anima ventures into lush deep house territory with big drums, groovy bass lines, and classical music influences. The remix from Anduaga brings these elements and wraps them in a peak time techno affair made for those late night big rooms, and Primordial Om's version gives the track a breakbeat injection with shuffling loops, racing 16th patterns, warped melodies, and bottom heavy low end. \\n' Here at the label trying we're always trying to push new and inspiring sounds and this EP is no exception",

'Drive Through The Crazy' is his newest offering and it features 3 original tracks, plus a remix by one of the 3Bridge captains, Eric Shans. 'Through You feat. Tarynn Hailey' starts things off and it takes a straight-ahead dirty, deep, tech house approach that aims straight for the dancers. A big bass riff and kick guide the proceedings here and piano type leads, random percussive elements, and Tarynn's repeated vocal line are generously spread out in the mix. It also has a breakdown with an unexpected twist which will surprise you in the best way possible. It's a track that could be played at any hour of the party. 'Drive Me Crazy' comes next and it's an interesting meld of styles. Crunchy percussion, a fat bottom end, along with twisted vocal snippets guide the track along. Off-kilter arpeggios and synth swells blanket it with melodic twists and turns that play off of each other. The second version, the 'Eric Shans Mental Health Mix', is appropriately named. It ups the energy of the track frenetically with two bass riffs going back and forth coinciding with sharp racing hi-hats, distorted leads, and shuffling drums. 'Pieces Of Meat, Waiting For A Butcher' takes things into the deep end closing out the EP with a humungous low end, snares that smack away relentlessly, big synthesizer lines, and twisted movie samples. This is one for those late hours into the morning and it's a real treat for the ears and the mind. Get yourself through the crazy and grab this EP for your sets. You'll find plenty of reasons to play it. 'Through You' mixed and engineered by Tony Grund. EP mastered by Jeff Clarke.",

It's a single with remixes by 3Bridge Records' creative director Eric Shans and label regular, Gatto. Dulcie is Will's spider friend and he thought it'd be appropriate to dedicate a song to her. The original is a lovely foray into acid house. A precise drum pattern glues the track together with an exceptional 303 bass line that rips through the track. It's echoed by dramatic strings, playful arpeggios, and an overall groovy palette. Eric's remix takes those elements and adds some trademark cinematic touches while keeping the groove intact. There's also an interesting vocal sample that describes a dialogue with a spider which is quite bizarre, yet captivating. And to close things out, Gatto's 'Spider's on Acid Mix' goes in a hypnotic tech direction with big percussion, fat low end, and walls of atmosphere. Catch this great single and get your acid fix.",

A soft synth pad peeks its head in every now and again giving a melodic flourish over some of the percussive madness. This one is for the peak hours and the early mornings when the energy is on high. 'Materialize' is the second track and and it continues Sleepy & Boo's appreciation for all things dub. They've crafted another dancefloor gem that is powered by deep stabs, ping ponging delays, and arpeggiated melodies, all anchored by a heavy percussive groove and cavernous atmospheres. Closing this EP out is 'Rise', which is certain to leave a lasting impression on the crowd. Inspired by early Detroit vibes, this one mixes a deep and unforgettable melodic line with hypnotic synth stabs and arpeggiated analog leads. 'Rise' is all about the positive vibes that Sleepy & Boo create in their DJ sets, and has already gotten great reactions when played out.We're very excited to put this EP out to start the year strongly.
