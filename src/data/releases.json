Always trying to push the envelope both creatively and sonically, it's a killer 2 tracker that will fill your dance floors with energy and good vibes. \\n'The title track takes a monstrous bass line, thumping drums, anthemic chords, and twinkling arpeggios which really go for the late night peak time sound. 'Fractals' focuses on thick analog sounding low end, big synths, melodic pads, and clean retro-future percussion, as well as some fun vocals thrown in the mix.

		"description": "Mexico City based artist Eisenheim is back on 3Bridge with a killer EP called 'Archetypes'. It features 2 original tracks with remixes by Primordial Om and Anduaga. Opening track 'Archetype 1:Selbst' is a foray into melodic breakbeat oriented electronica with mystical ethereal voices, big arpeggios, and cinematic pads. Archetype 2: Anima ventures into lush deep house territory with big drums, groovy bass lines, and classical music influences. The remix from Anduaga brings these elements and wraps them in a peak time techno affair made for those late night big rooms, and Primordial Om's version gives the track a breakbeat injection with shuffling loops, racing 16th patterns, warped melodies, and bottom heavy low end. \\n' Here at the label trying we're always trying to push new and inspiring sounds and this EP is no exception",

'Labrea to Dekalb' goes into full on deep house territory with soft Chicago-sounding pads, slick percussion, and melodic riffs that highlight the groove.

		"description": "Another new signing for 2019, we welcome The Company Soundsystem (aka Alex Musto) to 3Bridge Records. 'Drive Through The Crazy' is his newest offering and it features 3 original tracks, plus a remix by one of the 3Bridge captains, Eric Shans. 'Through You feat. Tarynn Hailey' starts things off and it takes a straight-ahead dirty, deep, tech house approach that aims straight for the dancers. A big bass riff and kick guide the proceedings here and piano type leads, random percussive elements, and Tarynn's repeated vocal line are generously spread out in the mix. It also has a breakdown with an unexpected twist which will surprise you in the best way possible. It's a track that could be played at any hour of the party. 'Drive Me Crazy' comes next and it's an interesting meld of styles. Crunchy percussion, a fat bottom end, along with twisted vocal snippets guide the track along. Off-kilter arpeggios and synth swells blanket it with melodic twists and turns that play off of each other. The second version, the 'Eric Shans Mental Health Mix', is appropriately named. It ups the energy of the track frenetically with two bass riffs going back and forth coinciding with sharp racing hi-hats, distorted leads, and shuffling drums. 'Pieces Of Meat, Waiting For A Butcher' takes things into the deep end closing out the EP with a humungous low end, snares that smack away relentlessly, big synthesizer lines, and twisted movie samples. This is one for those late hours into the morning and it's a real treat for the ears and the mind. Get yourself through the crazy and grab this EP for your sets. You'll find plenty of reasons to play it. 'Through You' mixed and engineered by Tony Grund. EP mastered by Jeff Clarke.",

It's a single with remixes by 3Bridge Records' creative director Eric Shans and label regular, Gatto. Dulcie is Will's spider friend and he thought it'd be appropriate to dedicate a song to her. The original is a lovely foray into acid house. A precise drum pattern glues the track together with an exceptional 303 bass line that rips through the track. It's echoed by dramatic strings, playful arpeggios, and an overall groovy palette. Eric's remix takes those elements and adds some trademark cinematic touches while keeping the groove intact. There's also an interesting vocal sample that describes a dialogue with a spider which is quite bizarre, yet captivating. And to close things out, Gatto's 'Spider's on Acid Mix' goes in a hypnotic tech direction with big percussion, fat low end, and walls of atmosphere. Catch this great single and get your acid fix.",

The New York-based duo has delivered three slices of top-shelf techno focused on those foggy rooms with big stacks of speakers, a powerful collection of music that sets a firm intention for 2020.The title track 'Emerge' leads things off with an ominous hoover-esque bass line, driving highs, and deep chords that rip in and out of the percussion. A soft synth pad peeks its head in every now and again giving a melodic flourish over some of the percussive madness. This one is for the peak hours and the early mornings when the energy is on high. 'Materialize' is the second track and and it continues Sleepy & Boo's appreciation for all things dub. They've crafted another dancefloor gem that is powered by deep stabs, ping ponging delays, and arpeggiated melodies, all anchored by a heavy percussive groove and cavernous atmospheres. Closing this EP out is 'Rise', which is certain to leave a lasting impression on the crowd. Inspired by early Detroit vibes, this one mixes a deep and unforgettable melodic line with hypnotic synth stabs and arpeggiated analog leads. 'Rise' is all about the positive vibes that Sleepy & Boo create in their DJ sets, and has already gotten great reactions when played out.We're very excited to put this EP out to start the year strongly. This is Sleepy & Boo's 7th EP on 3Bridge Records, and 'Emerge' demonstrates their continued evolution and expansion as producers.",
