		"description": "One of the main 3Bridge Records bosses Eric Shans is back with his first original music of 2022, 'Cloud Bursts'. Always trying to push the envelope both creatively and sonically, it's a killer 2 tracker that will fill your dance floors with energy and good vibes. \\n'The title track takes a monstrous bass line, thumping drums, anthemic chords, and twinkling arpeggios which really go for the late night peak time sound. 'Fractals' focuses on thick analog sounding low end, big synths, melodic pads, and clean retro-future percussion, as well as some fun vocals thrown in the mix. You'd do well to pick this single up for your digital crates.",

		"description": "Mexico City based artist Eisenheim is back on 3Bridge with a killer EP called 'Archetypes'. It features 2 original tracks with remixes by Primordial Om and Anduaga. Opening track 'Archetype 1:Selbst' is a foray into melodic breakbeat oriented electronica with mystical ethereal voices, big arpeggios, and cinematic pads. Archetype 2: Anima ventures into lush deep house territory with big drums, groovy bass lines, and classical music influences. The remix from Anduaga brings these elements and wraps them in a peak time techno affair made for those late night big rooms, and Primordial Om's version gives the track a breakbeat injection with shuffling loops, racing 16th patterns, warped melodies, and bottom heavy low end. \\n' Here at the label trying we're always trying to push new and inspiring sounds and this EP is no exception",

'This This' goes more the sweaty techno-route with racing hi-hats, swirling atmospheres, and fat bottom end.'Kanterbury' will surely light up your DJ sets ; you can almost hear the strobe lights emanating from tracks.",

The title track showcases subwoofer type low-end, big waves of melodic pads, unique percussion patterns, and subtle vocal chops and 'What It Is' takes a bit more of a tech-house approach with a rumbling bass, smacking snares, and analog stabs. It's a perfect B-side highlighting the contrasts of the lights and the darks on the aural canvas.",

Racing percussion, old school organ riffs, and a repeated soulful vocal are the main drivers here. 'This Sick' comes next and adds a funky guitar riff over a repeated phrase with chunky beats. 'Constellations' falls into the groovy techno category with big leads over shuffling drums, and 'Open Shot' closes things out slowing down the tempo a tad but not without a nice energy to coast to the end of the record.",

A chunky, thick bass line, punchy drums, and a soulful vocal are the guiding factors here as it straddles the line between the sounds of house and techno. 'Labrea to Dekalb' goes into full on deep house territory with soft Chicago-sounding pads, slick percussion, and melodic riffs that highlight the groove. 'Quarantine' closes things out and it's the darkest of the 3 with a nasty bass line, twisted patterns, and great synth lines. We're psyched to start off a new year with some great music.
