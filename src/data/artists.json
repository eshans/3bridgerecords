    "name": "Eric Shans",
    "bio": "A producer and DJ residing in Brooklyn, NY, Eric Shans has been making and playing music for almost 20 years. He has always been influenced by melodic, dreamy sounds which have a smattering of grit underneath. Both under the synth pop sounding monikers Phenotract and Fermion (a duo), and under his own name, he has many releases and remixes that span the genres of deep house, tech house, techno, and ambient. The music he makes is truly reflective of the sounds he loves to hear; forward thinking and at times, wrapped in a sense of nostalgia. His DJ sets are also an embodiment of this as well, combining ethereal vocals, driving and dirty bass lines, and moving melodies for the heart, feet, and mind. He's played for years across many venues in the NYC area, including TBA Brooklyn, Cielo, Louie and Chan, various loft and private parties, and more. Eric also co-runs the labels 3Bridge Records and 3Bridge Elements based in Brooklyn and is one of the founders of the inTRANSIT parties which take place in New York City mainly at TBA Brooklyn, one of the borough's best underground clubs.",

    "bio": "Biographies are not a thing that I like to read, especially DJ ones. Most of them come with the “I have loved music since I was a baby…”, “House Music was love at first sight (or hearing)… So don't worry, because I'm not going to make it sound like being booked by the Top 10 best Night-clubs ever every night. I'm not going to say how I only play because of my deep love for music. That's not what you are going to read here. I'll say that I have been producing tracks as of late with a very talented vocalist, Moon Aton, and we have tracks on a few labels such as Be Adult, Color & Pitch, and now 3Bridge Records. And with DJing, simply, for me, it's all about mood and a deep, hypnotic groove… playing and producing those tracks that get you tapping your feet and nodding your head without you realizing it, regardless of genre, tempo, style, or release date.",
